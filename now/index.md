Last week we went backpacking in the "Lost Coast" in Nor Cal. It afforded some excellent thinking and walking time.
Also, surprised to see that my latest post [Teaching Computers Art History](/2018/06/20/using-a-computer-to-separate-fifteenth-from-seventeenth-century-data/) made it (briefly) to the Hacker News front page.

For this week, I want to establish a deeper understanding of more complicated Deep NN problems like multi-class classification and drawing bounding boxes for images.
