True enjoyment in life comes from many sources, but because we spend so much of our time engaged in it, it's only sensible that a fair portion of our pleasure come from work. 
For a long time I've been interested in finding ways to enjoy work more fully. There are some conflicting explanations. One common line is that the kinds of things we enjoy are innate. Perhaps, but there are lots of people who develop an interest in something that they hadn't been predisposed to, after spending some time learning it. Maybe then the answer lies with a conflicting popular explanation: you enjoy things that you are good at. Once you gain mastery at something, the theory goes, then you start to get pleasure from it.
