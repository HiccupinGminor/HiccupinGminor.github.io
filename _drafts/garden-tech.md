Using technology in the garden

These past few months, I've created a machine that I call "Saladbot". Its purpose is to grow a constant supply of salad mix. It plants seeds, waters them, and monitors plant growth. It can be improved in the future to apply fertilizer, identify weeds or pests, and perhaps even harvest matured leaves.

The project is based on FarmBot, a CNC-style farming robot. I found that the prospect of 

A farmer's final yield is a function of how much time they can invest in the time-consuming tasks of seeding, transplanting, weeding, and harvesting. Modern farmers have increasingly turned toward machine operated, manually-operated farms tend to be relegated. 

Moving toward Saladbot V2

V2 will be a radical departure from the fixed cnc in many ways. The new design will be a mobile bot, off the rails that operates on a fixed grid. The goal of the machine will be to help reduce costs for small-scale farming, by reducing the amount of labor required. Another goal is to make it feasible for home gardeners to grow a substantial amount of their own diets while requiring only minutes of upkeep per week.

Saladbot V2 has these design objectives:

- To be able to scale to a 1 acre farm
- To cost less than $1,000 to buy the base model
- To be able to manage herbs, salad, and cooking greens to start with ambitions to manage tomato, cucumber, pepper, and eggplant in the medium term
- To not require special expertise to assemble

These goals, if achieved, could revolutionize agriculture. The platform, although initially primitive in its abilities, would be sufficient to actuate most of the physical motions necessary for farming. The vast majority of the future improvements would be in the platform's software. 

Over time, it will develop a sophisticated expertise in growing food. Its small size and versatility will mean it can be used anywhere. It could be put to work in the vast fields of the American heartland, it could be employed in smaller-scale market gardens, or, even more tantalizing, it can be used in urban backyards to grow enough food for the occupants.

Why would such an invention be important? For several reasons:
1. To make sustainable farming profitable. Organic market gardeners have the extra burden imposed on them by their refusal to use pesticides. Pests take time to spot and manage, and oftentimes they are identified only after they have done significant damage to a crop. Saladbot V2 will be able to spot pests at their first appearance, potentially saving crops and improving yields for farmers and gardeners. 

2. Sustainable small-scale farming is also labor intensive. Having a machine like Saladbot will 

3. Saladbot can go places where humans can't. Saladbot will be light enough to operate on rooftops and in other spaces too dangerous for people. This opens up new real estate to being farm-able.

4. Saladbot will open up new urban sources of produce. Community gardens and urban farms will be viable 

The design:

Saladbot is a moving gantry robot that doesn't operate on tracks. Attached to the crossbeam of the gantry is a cnc-style head with grabber attachments for planting seeds, spraying water, pest control, and fertilizer solutions. The head also holds a camera which is used for sensing and detection operations.

Saladbot will have access to a mini greenhouse where it will inject seeds into pellets, water periodically, and 

The critical functions - planting, transplanting, and managing pests are incredibly time-consuming operations that require relatively skilled labor. Yet small-scale farms rarely have the money to pay for such labor, and so production is always constrained by the number of volunteers and interns that can be recruited to work for nothing or next to nothing. The solution is automation. With automation, humans can work on things that are difficult for repeated task machines to manage. Things like deploying hoop houses during cold periods or installing bird netting, monitoring the biology of soil, and transporting produce to market. With staff that manage the repetitive tasks of the farm, farmers can plant more acreage, which in turn may boost yields and incomes.  

Saladbot will come in an easy-to-assemble kit. It will cost less than $1,000, and will save considerably more than that in labor costs within its first year of operation. Smaller, specialized Saladbots will be even cheaper and designed to garden in smaller areas like backyard gardens or community plots. Initially, saladbot will be restricted to growing greens and herbs. I suspect that greens and herbs represent the bulk of the non-fruit, non-root produce purchased, and thus this limitation will not prevent Saladbot from proving useful in the short term. Longer term, Saladbot would need very little adjustment to be productive in a Tomato, Pepper, or Cucumber garden.

The garden tasks that most prevent the busy home gardener from turning spare land into a stream of fresh vegetables are, seeding / transplanting (many home gardeners simply buy nursery starts), pest control, weed control, watering, and fertilization. If these tasks can be effectively executed, the home gardener will experience a new source of trustworthy fresh food that will nourish and delight them.
