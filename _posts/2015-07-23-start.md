This blog is an experiment for me.
I’d like to achieve the following with it:

1. Practice the arts of writing and communication on a regular basis.
2. Keep a record of the things I was thinking about or working on at this point in time.
3. Explore writing as a medium of thought and introspection.
4. Interface with others through what I write, and through what they write.

I envision most posts will have some technical slant to them as I am a software programmer by trade and enjoy tinkering with electronics and writing code in my spare time. I intend to write about projects that I’m working on that excite me. Recently, I have developed the habit of selecting a particular topic of study each week, researching that topic, and then summarizing my learnings in a one-pager. I hope to share a few of these overviews. I’d also like to review some books that I’ve read. I think my reporting on these activities will help motivate me to do a better job on them in the first place.

Despite my interest in writing, I get very few everyday opportunities to keep the fires kindled beyond writing work e-mails, and I hope this blog will give me the chance to keep writing. I’m excited to see where this leads!
